A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server automatically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network. This prevents IP conflicts and simplifies network management.

1️⃣ Steps of DHCP IP Assignment
1️⃣ Device Sends a DHCP Discover (Broadcast)

When a device joins a network, it sends a DHCP Discover message to find a DHCP server.
This message is broadcast to all devices (255.255.255.255).
2️⃣ DHCP Server Responds with an Offer

The DHCP server sends a DHCP Offer, suggesting an available IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS server.
3️⃣ Device Requests the IP

The device responds with a DHCP Request, asking to use the offered IP.
4️⃣ DHCP Server Confirms the Lease

The server sends a DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK) confirming the assigned IP.
The device can now use the IP address for a specified lease time.
2️⃣ Example of DHCP Process
Step	Message Sent	Purpose
1️⃣	DHCP Discover	Device requests an IP
2️⃣	DHCP Offer	Server offers an available IP
3️⃣	DHCP Request	Device confirms selection
4️⃣	DHCP ACK	Server assigns the IP
3️⃣ What Happens When Lease Time Expires?
The device renews its IP before expiration.
If the device disconnects, the server reclaims the IP and assigns it to another device.
